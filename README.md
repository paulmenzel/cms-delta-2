CMS | delta II
==============

there are many content management systems in the wild - starting in 1999 i build the first of my own „CMS | alpha”, rewrote it as „CMS | beta” in 2002 and used PHP4. 2005 i wrote „CMS | gamma” and rode the horse a long way til now …
in 2011 i started a compleate rewrite and hired a friend, payed him about 30 k€ but he did a mess and so i dumped the CMS | delta and started over with „CMS | delta 2” wich is based on Rails 4 now.

The CMS | delta II is open source and it uses 1 + n running applications for a multi-project environment. 

/cms/...

this is the CMS-Application. It has one Database for each project.


/client/...

this is one Web-Siete-Application. You can use as mana clients as you wish to have multiple websites running, based on the same backend.
