CMS | delta II
==============

There are many content management systems in the wild – starting in 1999 I built the first of my own “CMS | alpha” and rewrote it in 2002 as “CMS | beta” with PHP4. 2005 I wrote “CMS | gamma” and rode the horse a long way until now …

In 2011, I started a complete rewrite and hired a friend, payed him about 30 k€ but he did a mess and so i dumped the CMS | delta and started over with “CMS | delta 2” which is based on Rails 4 now.

The CMS | delta II is Open Source and it uses 1 + n running applications for a multi-project environment. 

/cms/...

this is the CMS application. It has one database for each project.

/client/...

this is one Web Site application. You can use as many clients as you wish to have multiple Web sites running, based on the same backend.
